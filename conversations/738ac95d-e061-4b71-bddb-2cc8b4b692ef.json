    "content": "<think>\nOkay, so the question is: Are closures of connected sets themselves connected? Hmm, let me think. I remember that in topology, a connected set is one that cannot be divided into two non-empty disjoint open sets. And the closure of a set is the original set plus all its limit points. So if I take a connected set and add all its limit points, does it stay connected?\n\nFirst, maybe I should recall some examples. Let's take a simple connected set, like an open interval in the real line. Say (0,1). Its closure is [0,1], which is still connected. That works. What about a more complicated connected set? Maybe a circle with a point missing? The closure would be the whole circle, which is connected. So that seems okay too.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a tricky example where the closure becomes disconnected. Let me try to think of one. Suppose I have two tangent circles in the plane, but remove the point where they touch. So the original set is two circles intersecting at a single point, and then we remove that point. Is that set connected? Hmm, if they are tangent, removing the tangent point would make them disconnected. Wait, no. If two circles are tangent, they meet at one point. If you remove that point, then they become separated. So the original set is disconnected. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe take a connected set whose limit points somehow form a disconnected set. Hmm. Let's think in the real line again. Suppose I have a connected set like the irrational numbers. Wait, no, the irrationals are totally disconnected. Wait, no, in the real line, the connected sets are intervals. So the irrationals are not connected. So maybe that's not the right example.\n\nAlternatively, think of the topologist's sine curve. That's a classic example. The topologist's sine curve is the set S defined as {(x, sin(1/x)) | x ∈ (0,1]} union {0}×[-1,1]. Wait, actually, the closure of the topologist's sine curve is connected, but it's not path-connected. But in this case, the original set is the graph of sin(1/x) for x in (0,1], which is connected, and its closure includes the vertical segment at x=0. The closure is connected, even though the original set wasn't compact. So that's an example where the closure of a connected set is connected.\n\nBut maybe there's a case where the closure is disconnected. Let me try to construct such an example. Suppose I take two disjoint closed disks in the plane, and connect them with a line segment. Then remove the line segment. The original set would be the two disks, which are disconnected. But if I take a connected set, maybe like a line segment that approaches two points in different disks but doesn't include them. Wait, that might not work.\n\nAlternatively, take a connected set that is a sequence of points converging to two different limit points. For example, in the plane, take two points A and B, and a sequence of points that alternates between getting closer to A and B. If the original set is the sequence of points, which is connected? Wait, a sequence of points is disconnected unless it's a single point. Because each point is isolated. So that's not connected.\n\nHmm. Maybe take a connected set in the plane that is like a comb space, but modified. The standard comb space is connected but not path-connected. Its closure is still the same set, I think. Wait, no. The comb space is closed in itself, but maybe if you take a different topology. Wait, maybe not helpful.\n\nWait, let's think of the closure operation. The closure of a set A is the smallest closed set containing A. So if A is connected, is its closure necessarily connected? Suppose, for contradiction, that the closure of A is disconnected. Then the closure can be written as two disjoint non-empty closed sets. But since the closure contains A, then A would be contained in the union of these two closed sets. But A is connected, so it must lie entirely within one of them. But then the other closed set would contain only limit points of A. But if A is entirely in one closed set, then all its limit points should also be in that closed set, right? Because limit points of A are limits of sequences in A, and if A is entirely in a closed set, then the limit would also be in that closed set. Therefore, the other closed set in the closure must be empty. Contradiction. Therefore, the closure of a connected set is connected.\n\nWait, that seems like a proof. Let me check again. Suppose cl(A) = C ∪ D, where C and D are disjoint non-empty closed sets. Since A is connected, A must be entirely in C or entirely in D. Suppose A is in C. Then all limit points of A must be in the closure of C, which is C itself since C is closed. Therefore, cl(A) is contained in C, which contradicts that D is non-empty. Similarly, if A is in D, same contradiction. Therefore, cl(A) cannot be disconnected. Therefore, the closure of a connected set is connected.\n\nSo the answer should be yes. But let me verify with another example. Take the open unit ball in R^n. Its closure is the closed unit ball, which is connected. Take a connected space like a circle minus a point; closure is the whole circle, connected. Another example: take a connected set in a space that isn't Hausdorff? Hmm, maybe in a non-Hausdorff space, closures can behave differently. But the standard definition of connectedness is in general topology, regardless of separation axioms. Wait, but even in non-Hausdorff spaces, the argument above should hold. If the closure is disconnected, then the original set must lie entirely in one of the closed sets, and hence the closure can't have points in the other set. So maybe the closure of a connected set is always connected, in any topological space.\n\nWait, but let me think of a possible example in a non-T1 space. Suppose we have a space"

    "content": "<think>\nOkay, so the user asked if the closure of a connected set is always connected. Let me walk through my thought process again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, I recalled the definitions: a connected set can't be split into two non-empty disjoint open sets, and the closure includes all limit points. Then I considered examples like open intervals whose closures are closed intervals (still connected) and the topologist's sine curve, where the closure adds a vertical line but remains connected. These examples supported the idea that closures preserve connectedness.\n\nI tried to think of a counterexample where the closure becomes disconnected. I considered removing a point from two tangent circles, but realized the original set would already be disconnected. Then I thought about sequences approaching two points, but realized isolated points aren't connected. \n\nNext, I moved to a general proof approach. Suppose the closure of a connected set A is disconnected, meaning it can be split into two disjoint non-empty closed sets. Since A is connected, it must lie entirely within one of these sets. But then all limit points of A would also be in that same closed set, making the other set empty—a contradiction. This logical argument confirmed that the closure must be connected.\n\nI also considered non-Hausdorff spaces but realized the proof doesn't rely on separation axioms. The key is that limit points of a set in one part of a separation can't belong to the other part. Thus, regardless of the space, the closure of a connected set remains connected.\n\nDouble-checking with various examples (open balls, circle with a point removed) reinforced the conclusion. No counterexamples came to mind, and the proof holds. So the answer is yes.\n</think>\n\nYes, the closure of a connected set is always connected. Here's a concise summary:\n\n1. **Definitions**:  \n   - A set is **connected** if it cannot be partitioned into two non-empty disjoint open subsets.  \n   - The **closure** of a set includes the set itself and all its limit points.\n\n2. **Key Proof Idea**:  \n   Suppose the closure of a connected set \\( A \\) is disconnected. Then \\( \\overline{A} = C \\cup D \\), where \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) are disjoint non-empty closed sets. Since \\( A \\) is connected, it must lie entirely in \\( C \\) or \\( D \\). However, all limit points of \\( A \\) (which are in \\( \\overline{A} \\)) must also lie in the same closed set as \\( A \\), leaving no room for \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) to both be non-empty. This contradiction implies \\( \\overline{A} \\) is connected.\n\n3. **Examples**:  \n   - The closure of an open interval \\( (0,1) \\) is \\( [0,1] \\), which is connected.  \n   - The closure of the topologist’s sine curve (a connected set) remains connected.  \n\n**Conclusion**: In any topological space, the closure of a connected set is connected."
